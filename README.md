# CDCMX Challenge Task 7

Objective: Explain the process of purification of a protein and how is the protein's structure determined by the cryo-EM technique including an overview of the obstacles in this process.

Based on the Article "SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 spike glycoprotein structures inform on virus evolution and furin-cleavage effects" published on Nature structural and molecular biology by Antoni G. Wrobel, Donald J. Benton, Pengqi Xu, Chloe Roustan, Stephen R. Martin, Peter B. Rosenthal, et. al

## Purification of proteins

1. Proteins need to be expressed in a cell culture to produce them in large quantities for specific subjects of study. 

Spike glycoproteins in the comparative study of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were expressed in Expi293 cells - a human cell lineage for culture which have higher protein expresison levels and rapid cell growth compared to other cell lineages - at 37Â°C and 125 r.p.m. These cells were cultured in a FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium - a free protein medium that enhances cell transfection - and transfected (or delivered with external nucleic acids) with DNA and ExpiFectamine 293 - a transfection reagent that boosts protein expression and folding. The supernatants were collected during the 3rd or 4th day and 6th or 7th day after culture and were clarified, filtered and incubated with affinity resin.

2. Protein purification is important to avoid pollutants in our subjects of study and get more reliable results.

Spike proteins were bound to TALON cobalt leads (a purification resin which delivers his-tagged proteins of the highest purity), washed and eluted (reverse process of binding to the resin) with imidazol. ACE2 was bounded to Strep-Tactin XT resin (part of a purification system for recombined proteins). The protein was eluted with Strep-Tactin Elution Buffer BXT. Next, all proteins were flash-frozen (get frozen in a short amount of time due to exposition to cryogenic temperatures or liquid nitrogen)or gel-filtration (process of separation of molecules based on their ability to enter the pores of the gel-filtration medium) a Superdex 200 Increase column which delivers higher resolution purification in a short time.
